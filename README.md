# Welcome to the < br > ricolos's repo !
## 🏆 Winning team of the dev track !
⚠️ You can check this demo repository, but be warned : it's hackathon code ;)<br/><br/>
This project has been created during a 3 days coding Hackathon, organized by ManoMano & Wild Code School, whose theme was 'The future of ecommerce'<br/>
Our idea was to add a community and hands-on experience to the shopping user journey : before ordering 🛠️, clients can send their cart with friends by email and save a work date at the same time. Friends can contribute 🔗 to the shopping list, adding materials in it, and share their diy tips on D day !<br/><br/>

💻 Les <br> icolos, our team, was formed by Sophie Lepert, Etienne Fromentin, Matthieu Lemarchand, Benjamin Girard and I, Charlotte Ménard. <br/>
This project uses Javascript, React, Node.js and CSS3.<br/>
